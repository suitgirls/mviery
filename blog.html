        <h2>The Success of Maureen Baginski</h2>
        <p>Melany Viery / July 23th, 2024</p>
        <p>
            Maureen Baginski first worked with the NSA and was in the third highest position there. In 2003 she realized someone from the NSA said 9/11 was a gift to the NSA, which motivated her to relocate with the FBI. She became the executive assistant director of the FBI. From 2003-2005 she led the first intelligence program created. This program helped find and stop terrorist attacks. She also worked in aiding other intelligence professionals to improve in their careers. She used her intelligence for the good of others and the nation.

            Baginski accomplished a great amount and to this day serves as an inspiration for women. She also got recognition for these skills and actions. She was acknowledged by George W. Bush, FBI Director, and many other respectable persons. Some of many of awards she got were two Presidential Rank Awards, two Director of Central Intelligence National Achievement Medals, and NSAâ€™s Exceptional Civilian Service Award. Maureen Baginski left her first position because she was a good civilian and an honorable woman. She not only reminds women how intelligent we can be, but how loving we are as well.
