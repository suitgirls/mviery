     Melany Viery
    </p>
    <p>
     I am a rising senior class of 2025 located in Bronx, NY
    </p>
    <p>
     I decided to take this class to gain more experience with technology since it is already a big part of my life. I would like to use the skills I learn here in my future experiences like medicine and possibly use them to involve myself in church.
    </p> 
    <p>
     I like the idea of graphic designing and making presentations with technology. I also like typing rather than writing. In general, I like using technology because it makes things simple and pleasing in my everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of school I am very active. I love volleyball and playing sports.<strong>Commodore 64</strong> I am a Christian and I go to church, and I try to stay involved and help in what I can. I live with my parents and older sister. I love the show Manifest. I love singing and dancing even though I am not great at it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am liking this college experience and the independence I am learning through it.
